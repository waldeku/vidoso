# React Tab Search App

This is a simple React application that allows users to search and filter through users and posts fetched from the JSONPlaceholder API. The application features a search bar in the header and two tabs below it, showing filtered results based on the search query. The app uses React Router for tab navigation and Radix UI for the tab components.

## Features

- **Search Functionality**: Users can search through the lists of users and posts.
- **Tab Navigation**: Two tabs allow users to switch between viewing users and posts.
- **Persistent Search Query**: The search query is stored in the browser's `localStorage` and persists even after the page is reloaded.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: The core JavaScript library used for building the user interface.
- **React Router**: Used for managing routes and navigation within the app.
- **Radix UI**: A library of accessible and customizable components used for the tab layout.
- **JSONPlaceholder API**: The source of data for users and posts.
